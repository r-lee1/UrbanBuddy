## Urban Buddy

### Background and Overview
Urban Buddy is a data visualization tool that allows users to look up and compare life quality data between urban cities.

Oftentimes, professionals and students need to relocate to new and unfamiliar areas. This tool can provide some insight on a new city that will soon be called home.

### Functionality & MVP
* Users will be able to select a city from a dropdown menu. The information and data chart for the city will display.
* When two cities are selected, a comparison chart of life quality scores between the two will display.

#### Bonus:
* Google Maps Geolocation
* Images of cities

### Wireframes
Urban Buddy will consist of a single screen with two dropdown menus for the user to select cities of interest.  Below that, are individual displays of information and data for each city, and a display for the comparison chart.
